Hello everyone. It's been almost a year, since I started to post in this sub-reddit. I‚Äôve been reading some stories from fellow ThinkPad fans and was inspired to start write mine.

As title says my laptop freezes randomly. i dont know what the cause is. it was working fine since i started playing again with this new laptop from last month. I am experiencing these freezes more frequently now and its over a week already and i tried searching and fixing things on my own. i even tried going back to my initial ati drivers that came with laptop release. I dont know what to do but its really annoying to play with this freeze that can kill you or even wipe the group.

I have an semi-old laptop that brightness acting weird. Keyboard and power manager applet controls works, after restart remembers the last brightness value, but if screen goes off after idle timeout (or screensaver starting after timeout or lockscreen), and after I wake up the screen, brightness goes to maximum. Power manager applet's brightness slider still shows last value (for example 60% when I last set the value) but brightness is maximum (as it hurts my eyes) Hello there, As in the title I have a problem with my Mint and drivers.

I had a laptop in my room on Wifi and it could get 4.5mbps connection and load 480p videos without a problem. I replaced it with my old Desktop as it has a graphic card for games. The problem is that it has a built in network card from like 2008 and it is very slow. I can't post a speedtest.net speed since it won't bloody load. Any thing I can do to speed up the wifi speed on my desktop? I can't even load images properly which sucks. What alternatives do I have to this card? I have tried lookin.

I wound up wiping it 4 times, going back and forth between 64/32-bit and 12.10/12.04 versions. In the end, 32-bit 12.04 LT was best.

My laptop is currently 3 years old, and it has been running very well, it works just brand new, it doesn't overheat a single bit playing heavy games / rendering. ( Highest temperature in the last month has been 70¬∫ C ) Just a few days ago, it suddenly stopped working, and after rebooting it it shows a black screen after. So I was playing a game at my buddies house (League of Legends to be exact, graphics were on high, shadows were set to off, due to lag spike) And was using a Cooler Master laptop fan at the time, The screen went black for about 15 seconds, flashed about 3 times, stayed black for 5 more seconds, then the game would resume. First time it happened I figured it was just another application interfering. This happened about 10 more times, till I restarted the computer and re-opened the game. Hello /r/techsupport. Once again I find myself stuck and in need of help. I'm setting up a flight simulator build. 6 monitors, one machine and I'm running into some problems.
